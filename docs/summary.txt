W3C DISCUSSION BOARD
------------------------------------
The site discussed is where the different solutions to issues raised by W3C are posted.
The site is supposed to act as the replacement for the mailing list format used by W3C
currently.

* The site will hold the problems proposed
  * Problems can be browsed [most recent sorting for now]
  * Problems have states [crowd suggested, W3C proposed, accepted, rejected, frozen/pending review]
  * Problems can be added by anyone [title, "owner" with link, references with links, demo link, description]
  * Problems can be edited by anyone [title, "owner" with link, references with links, demo link, description]
  * States can be changed by anyone
  * Problems can be expanded to show all their solutions
* Each solution will be linked with the problem
  * Solutions can be browsed [most recent sorting]
  * Solutions have states as well [open, accepted, rejected]
  * Solutions can be added by anyone [title, "owner" with link, references with links, demo link, description]
  * Solutions can be edited by anyone [title, "owner" with link, references with links, demo link, description]
  * States of solutions can be changed by anyone
  * Solutions can be upvoted (but not downvoted)
  * Solutions can be expanded to show the discussion thread (Disqus)
* System keeps track of the users via the Twitter's OAuth system
* Edits on problems and solutions will be tracked by revision
  * Each revision is tied to the particular Twitter user
  * Blacklisting allows to specify the Twitter users without ability to edit
* Descriptions will use Markdown for formatting
  * Markdown is rendered server-side, but the actual markdown content is provided as well
  * Editing will transparently turn the content area into form, prepopulated with Markdown
  * After editing, new content is AJAX-ed back to the server, whereas website generates HTML client-side
* Four-column layout to be used on standard size screens. Three columns for content, one for nav and about
  * Decrease the number of columns as screen gets smaller, move the navigation to the top (column span)
  * If the demo is on JSFiddle, embed it, otherwise provide a big button pointing to it
